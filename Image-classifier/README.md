Dog breed Classification
This notebook uses multiclass classification and works as an image classifier using Tensorflow 2.0 and Tensorflow Hub.

Problem Definition
Build a model which can identify the dog breed from an image of a dog fed to the model

Data
The data used is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data

Evaluations
The evaluation is a file with the prediction probablities for each dog breed of test image

Features
Information about the data:

We are dealing with images(unstructured data) hence it is best to use deep learning and transfer learning
There are 120 breeds of dogs (This means that there a total of 120 different classes)
10000+ images in the training and the test set.
